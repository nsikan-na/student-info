# Student Inforamtion #
[Visit Live Site](https://nakpan.info/studentinfo/resetlogin.php)

This is an application where a teacher can manage student's information. My focus on this project was to connect to a database and to grant permissions/ CRUD (create,read,update,destroy) actions to user if they provide valid credentials. (Fake Login Provided) This was built using Html, Css, BootStrap, JavaScript, Php, and Sql.


## Project Requirements ##
* The teacher is able to view all the information without signing in, but must sign in to be able to add, update, or delete student information. 
* The teacher can setup a new account if they do not already have one
* User can also change their password once they sign in.
