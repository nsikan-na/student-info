# Manage Student Information
This is a application where a teacher can manage their student's information. The teacher is able to view all the information without signing in, but must sign in to be able to add, update, or delete student information. The teacher can setup a new account if they do not already have one, and can also change their password once they sign in.

(I provide a demo option to allow you to skip the sign in process and see all the features.)
