This is an application where a teacher can manage student's information. My focus on this project was to connect to a database and to grant permissions/ CRUD (create,read,update,destroy) actions to user if they provide valid credentials. (Fake Login Provided) This was built using Html, Css, BootStrap, JavaScript, Php, and Sql.
