My focus on this project was to connect to a database and perform basic CRUD (create,read,update,destroy) actions to grant permessions to user if they provide valid credentials.

(This was built early in my journey, but I think was a solid beginning and I learned a lot.)

## Project Requirements ##
* This is a application where a teacher can manage their student's information. 
* The teacher is able to view all the information without signing in, but must sign in to be able to add, update, or delete student information. 
* The teacher can setup a new account if they do not already have one
* User can also change their password once they sign in.

## This was build using ##
* Html
* Css
* Bootstrap
* Javascript

* Sql


## What I Learned: ##
* Structuring Relational Databases
* Getting Data from forms
* Getting Data from Database
